Adaptive Robotization

%input = input signal (mono or stereo)

%winlength = feature extraction analysis window length in samples (suggested 512 or 1024)

%hopmethod = robot pitch mapping method: 'centroid' or 'yin'

%
%The function adaptively maps features extracted 1) RMS and 2) spectral

%centroid or YIN autocorrelation from input signal to 1) analysis/synthesis

%block size, related to robot roughness and 2) synthesis hop size, related

%to robot pitch.  The samples are set to zero between synthesis grains.
